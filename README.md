## C# projects
Here are some of the interesting projects in my C# repo

+ [Blackjack](https://github.com/aamasse16/C-Sharp-basic-projects/tree/main/TwentyOne21)

+ [Car Insurance](https://github.com/aamasse16/C-Sharp-basic-projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)

### Blackjack
In this project you can play a fully functioning game of blackjack through the console. When the code is executed you will be asked for your name and how much money you brought with you. Then you will be asked if you would like to play, after typing yes you will be dealt 2 cars and so will the dealer and from there you play blackjack.

### Car Insurance
In this MVC web application a user who would represent a car insurance customer can create an "profile" and based off of their inputs the application will create a quote for them. On top of that there is also an Admin view that can see all of the "profiles" and all of this user input will go directly into the database.
